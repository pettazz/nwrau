Noble View is one of the Appalachian Mountain Club's larger land holdings. Noble View Outdoor Center's 358.5 acres of rural solitude maintain the ambiance of the original 1800s New England farmstead. A pristine mountaintop location offers breathtaking views of the Pioneer Valley east to Mt. Wachusett. Wendy and Nick enjoy taking their four dogs here on the weekends. 

 As you can probably tell from this description, Noble View is a rustic setting. **While we invite you to wear your favorite party dress or suit, high heeled shoes are not recommended.**

- Cross through the intersection at Northwest Road and start up the mountain on General Knox Road.
- Follow General Knox Road and turn left onto South Quarter Road at the historic General Knox marker in the small triangular common (2nd road on the left once you start up the mountain, 3.2 miles from the fork).
- Turn left into Noble View (1.2 miles from General Knox road).
- Go up the entry road until you reach the facility.

## Camping 

You can pitch a tent at Noble View! 

Tent camping is permitted in Saunders Corners at the north end of the Link Trail in the clearing south of the Double Cottage. Unfortunately Noble View is not able to accomodate trailers/RVs - tents only.

We have booked all of Noble View for our wedding weekend, so you don't have to contact Noble View to make reservations - we just ask that you send us an email at <a href="mailto:wedding@nwrau.com">wedding@nwrau.com</a> and let us know your intent to camp, just so we have an idea on numbers.

All campers are welcome to start arriving at noon on Saturday!

## Transportation

We will have school bus transportation to and from Noble View for the wedding!

The bus will arrive at the Holiday Inn Express & Suites at 2:00pm on Saturday and depart at 2:15pm. It will then depart for the Quality Inn, arriving around 2:20pm on Saturday.
At 2:35pm the bus will depart from the Quality Inn for Noble View.

The bus will make two return trips on Saturday night, at 9:00 pm and at 10:00pm, stopping at both hotels.

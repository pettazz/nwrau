## New Orleans, LA

We are going to start our honeymoon off by spending a few night in the French Quarter.


## Western Caribbean Cruise

We'll board the Carnival Dream in New Orleans for a 7 day Western Caribbean cruise.

Our boat will be stopping in Cozumel, Mexico, Belize, and Mahogany Bay, Isle Roatan. We plan to do a tequilla tour of Mexica, explore Mayan ruins in Belize, and go zip-lining in  Mahogany Bay!

We will update everyone with pictures when we return.
